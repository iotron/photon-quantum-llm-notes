# 8. Project Implementations - Quantum Karts

## Overview
Quantum Karts (version 3.0.2) implements the Quantum Menu SDK to provide a racing game lobby system with support for up to 6 players. This implementation showcases how to adapt the SDK for a racing game context.

## Key Features
- **Max Players**: 6 players per race session
- **Game Type**: Multiplayer kart racing
- **Platform Support**: Mobile-optimized with adaptive framerate
- **Scene Management**: Custom scene configuration for race tracks

## Implementation Details

### Configuration
```yaml
Max Players: 6
Adaptive Framerate: Enabled
Available Regions: Global (11 regions)
App Version: 3.0
```

### Custom Assets
- **Default Scene Preview**: Custom racing track preview image
- **Scene Configuration**: Integrated with Quantum racing systems

### Connection Architecture
Uses the standard SDK connection behavior optimized for:
- Quick matchmaking for racing sessions
- Room filling for competitive races
- Regional matchmaking for low latency

### UI Adaptations
The menu system is adapted for racing game needs:
- **Main Menu**: Quick race and party options
- **Party System**: Pre-race lobby for friends
- **Loading Screen**: Track preview during loading
- **In-Game UI**: Racing-specific HUD elements

## Racing-Specific Features

### Matchmaking
- Optimized for filling rooms to capacity (6 players)
- Quick match options for instant racing
- Party codes for friend groups

### Scene Management
- Multiple track selection
- Track preview system
- Runtime configuration per track

### Performance Optimizations
- Mobile-friendly UI scaling
- Reduced UI complexity for better performance
- Efficient asset loading for tracks

## Integration Points

### With Racing Systems

The SDK seamlessly integrates with kart racing mechanics:

```csharp
// Example integration in game scenes
public class KartRaceManager : MonoBehaviour {
    private QuantumMenuConnectionBehaviour _connection;
    
    void Start() {
        _connection = FindObjectOfType<QuantumMenuConnectionBehaviourSDK>();
        
        // Access race configuration
        var maxPlayers = _connection.MaxPlayerCount; // Always 6 for karts
        var trackConfig = _connection.Runner.SessionConfig;
        
        // Setup race based on room properties
        SetupRaceForPlayers(maxPlayers);
    }
}
```

#### Menu Flow Integration
**Main Menu Scene**: Contains QuantumMenu prefab with racing customizations
**Track Selection**: Integrated into party menu system
**Loading Screen**: Shows track preview during connection

### Network Configuration
- Optimized for real-time racing physics
- Low-latency region selection
- Stable connection handling for races

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Racing Lobby
The SDK handles:
1. Player gathering in lobby
2. Track selection/voting
3. Kart customization sync
4. Race start synchronization

### During Race
- Connection stability monitoring
- Player disconnect handling
- Spectator mode for finished players

## Best Practices for Racing Games
1. **Lobby Timing**: Set appropriate countdown timers
2. **Player Limits**: 6 players optimal for kart racing
3. **Region Selection**: Prioritize low-latency regions
4. **Disconnect Handling**: Graceful handling of mid-race disconnects

## Customization Points
- Track selection UI can be customized
- Kart preview integration points
- Custom loading screen animations
- Race-specific ready checks
