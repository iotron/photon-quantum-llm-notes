# 14. Project Implementations - Other Projects

## Overview
This chapter covers Unity projects in the collection that have minimal or no integration with the Quantum Menu SDK. Understanding why these projects don't use the SDK can provide insights into when the SDK is most appropriate.

## Projects Without Full SDK Integration

### Quantum Motor Dome (3.0.2)

#### Current Status
- Contains `QuantumMenu` directory structure
- Only includes `Quantum-Menu.unitypackage.meta`
- Has `QuantumMenuSceneInfo.cs` reference
- No active implementation

#### Possible Reasons
1. **Project Type**: May use alternative menu systems
2. **Development Stage**: SDK not yet integrated
3. **Custom Requirements**: Specific needs not met by SDK
4. **Package Option**: Available but not unpacked

#### Integration Potential
The presence of the package suggests future integration is planned. The project could benefit from:
- Standardized multiplayer lobby system
- Cross-platform menu compatibility
- Integrated matchmaking features

### Quantum Starter (3.0.3)

#### Current Status
- Contains `QuantumMenuSceneInfo.cs`
- No `QuantumMenu` directory
- Minimal menu references

#### Purpose and Design
As a "starter" project, this likely:
1. **Serves as a blank slate** for developers
2. **Provides minimal structure** to avoid assumptions
3. **Allows custom implementation** choices
4. **Focuses on core Quantum** features without UI

#### When to Add SDK
Developers using Quantum Starter should consider adding the SDK when:
- Building multiplayer games requiring lobbies
- Needing standardized menu systems
- Wanting quick multiplayer prototyping
- Requiring cross-platform UI support

## SDK Integration Decision Matrix

### When to Use Quantum Menu SDK

| Project Type | SDK Recommended | Reason |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Multiplayer PvP | ✅ Yes | Lobby and matchmaking essential |
| Racing Games | ✅ Yes | Pre-race lobbies needed |
| Sports Games | ✅ Yes | Team formation required |
| FPS/Shooters | ✅ Yes | Server browser/quick match |
| Party Games | ✅ Yes | Room codes and friend invites |
| Single Player | ❌ No | Unnecessary overhead |
| Tech Demos | ❌ No | Focus on core features |
| Tutorials | ❓ Maybe | Depends on scope |

### When to Build Custom

Consider custom menu solutions when:
1. **Unique Requirements**: Non-standard lobby mechanics
2. **Branding Needs**: Completely custom UI/UX
3. **Platform Specific**: Console-specific requirements
4. **Minimal Multiplayer**: P2P without lobbies
5. **Educational Purpose**: Learning by building

## Migration Guide

### Adding SDK to Existing Projects

#### Step 1: Import Package
```csharp
// If package exists (like Motor Dome):
1. Locate Quantum-Menu.unitypackage
2. Import into project
3. Resolve any conflicts

// If starting fresh:
1. Copy QuantumMenu folder from another project
2. Update references and configs
```

#### Step 2: Configuration
1. Create `QuantumMenuConfig.asset`
2. Set max players and regions
3. Configure available scenes
4. Set up app versions

#### Step 3: Integration
1. Add menu prefab to scene
2. Connect to existing game systems
3. Implement connection callbacks
4. Test matchmaking flow

## Lessons from Non-Integrated Projects

### Flexibility is Key
The SDK's optional nature shows Photon's understanding that:
- Not all projects need full menu systems
- Developers may have existing solutions
- Custom implementations are sometimes necessary

### Gradual Adoption
Projects can:
- Start without SDK
- Add it when multiplayer features mature
- Use parts of SDK while keeping custom elements
- Migrate gradually from custom to SDK

### Best Practices
1. **Evaluate Early**: Decide on SDK usage during planning
2. **Prototype Both Ways**: Test with and without SDK
3. **Document Decision**: Record why SDK was/wasn't used
4. **Plan Migration Path**: Keep future integration possible

## Conclusion

The Quantum Menu SDK is a powerful tool for multiplayer game development, as demonstrated by the seven projects actively using it. However, the existence of projects without SDK integration shows that it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Understanding when and how to integrate the SDK is crucial for making the right architectural decisions for your project.

### Key Takeaways
- SDK excels for standard multiplayer patterns
- Custom solutions valid for unique requirements  
- Integration can be gradual
- Package availability enables future adoption
- Project requirements should drive the decision

Whether using the SDK or building custom solutions, the goal remains the same: creating engaging multiplayer experiences with smooth, intuitive menu systems.
