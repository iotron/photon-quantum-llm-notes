# Bot Implementation Best Practices

## Choosing the Right AI Model

### When to Use HFSM
- **Large numbers of agents**: Most efficient for many agents
- **Clear state transitions**: When behavior has well-defined states
- **Memory constraints**: Lowest memory footprint per agent
- **Hierarchical organization**: Complex behavior that fits a state hierarchy
- **Example uses**: Simple enemy behavior, game flow management

### When to Use Behavior Trees
- **Complex decision making**: More sophisticated logic than HFSMs
- **Reactive requirements**: When quick responses to events are needed
- **Moderate agent counts**: Good balance of features vs. performance
- **Reusable subtrees**: When behavior patterns can be reused
- **Example uses**: Combat AI, stealth behavior, complex NPC routines

### When to Use Utility Theory
- **Dynamic decision surface**: When scoring multiple options is natural
- **Unpredictable behavior**: Less rigid, more emergent behaviors
- **Continuous value spaces**: Behaviors dependent on numeric evaluations
- **Mathematical modeling**: When behavior fits mathematical curves
- **Example uses**: Strategic decision making, resource management AI

### Mixing Models
- Consider using different models for different aspects of AI
- HFSM for game management, BT for character behavior
- Create compound agents with multiple components
- Use the best tool for each specific job

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Usage
- HFSM: ~60-80 bytes per agent (lowest)
- BT: ~120-200 bytes per agent (moderate)
- UT: ~100-150 bytes per agent (moderate)
- Consider footprint when planning for many agents

### Computational Cost
- Use the appropriate update frequency for each system
- Split updates across frames when possible
- Only recalculate when inputs change
- Use Blackboard for sharing data efficiently

### Scaling Strategies
- HFSM scales best for many agents (50+)
- BT works well for moderate numbers (20-50)
- UT is suitable for fewer, more complex agents (5-20)
- Consider simplified AI for distant or less important agents

## Bot Design Principles

### Making Bots Feel Natural
1. **Add Imperfection**: Perfect aim/reaction feels artificial
2. **Include Delays**: Use AIMemory for realistic reaction times
3. **Limited Knowledge**: Bots shouldn't know what they can't see
4. **Variable Behavior**: Avoid predictable patterns
5. **Progressive Difficulty**: Scale bot capability with player skill

### Bot Balancing
1. **Tunable Parameters**: Create config variables for easy adjustments
2. **Difficulty Levels**: Prepare multiple AI configs for different levels
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjust bot behavior based on player performance
4. **Playtesting**: Regularly test with real players for balance feedback

### Data-Driven Approach
1. **Configurable Sensors**: Perception systems defined in data
2. **Ability Parameters**: Keep action capabilities in config
3. **Response Curves**: Define behavior responses mathematically
4. **Separation of Logic**: Keep decision making separate from execution

## Practical Implementation Tips

### Player Replacement
1. Use the `PlayerConnectedSystem` for detecting disconnections
2. Store original player data for potential reconnection
3. Initialize bot AI when a player disconnects
4. Remove bot AI when the player reconnects
5. Add a small visual indicator to show bot-controlled characters

### Room Filling
1. Check connected player count against desired count
2. Create bot entities to fill empty slots
3. Distribute bots evenly among teams
4. Give bots recognizable names (random from lists)
5. Consider creating bots with varied behaviors

### Debugging Strategies
1. Enable the `BotSDKDebuggerSystem` during development
2. Visualize sensor data for easier tuning
3. Log decision-making at key points
4. Create test scenarios that isolate specific behaviors
5. Use Unity's Debug.DrawLine for spatial visualization

### Code Organization
1. Separate input handling from character systems
2. Use components to flag bot-controlled entities
3. Create specialized systems for different AI aspects
4. Follow consistent naming conventions
5. Comment complex decision logic thoroughly

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Bot Clustering
- **Problem**: Bots tend to group together
- **Solution**: Add repulsion forces in steering, assign different objectives

### Unresponsive Behavior
- **Problem**: Bots stuck in states or not reacting
- **Solution**: Add timeout transitions, ensure all states have exit conditions

### Erratic Movement
- **Problem**: Jittery or unnatural navigation
- **Solution**: Smooth inputs, add movement dampening, use context steering

### Predictable Patterns
- **Problem**: Players exploit repetitive bot behavior
- **Solution**: Add randomization to decision making, create behavior variations

### Poor Navigation
- **Problem**: Bots getting stuck or taking bad paths
- **Solution**: Properly set up nav mesh, add special handling for obstacles

### Performance Issues
- **Problem**: Frame rate drops with many bots
- **Solution**: Optimize update frequency, simplify distant bot behavior
