## About This Documentation

This documentation was created based on the analysis of the quantum-botsdk-sample-development-3.0.0 project. It focuses on the bot implementation aspects of the Photon Quantum framework and provides guidance for developers implementing AI agents in their own Quantum-based games.

The sample code and implementations discussed in this documentation are based on the Collectors Sample and other examples provided in the Bot SDK.
