# Systems in Photon Quantum

## Overview

Systems in Quantum are where game logic is implemented. They process entities with specific component combinations and apply behavioral rules to update game state in a deterministic way.

## System Types

Quantum provides several base system classes:

### SystemMainThread

Base class for systems that run on the main thread.

```csharp
public class MySystem : SystemMainThread
{
    public override void Update(Frame frame)
    {
        // Process game logic
    }
}
```

### SystemMainThreadFilter

The most common system type, which processes entities with specific component combinations using a filter.

```csharp
public unsafe class MovementSystem : SystemMainThreadFilter<MovementSystem.Filter>
{
    public struct Filter
    {
        public EntityRef Entity;
        public Transform2D* Transform;
        public PlayerLink* PlayerLink;
        public Status* Status;
        public MovementData* MovementData;
        public KCC2D* KCC;
    }
    
    public override void Update(Frame frame, ref Filter filter)
    {
        // Process entities with these components
    }
}
```

### SystemSignalsOnly

Systems that only respond to signals and don't have an Update method.

```csharp
public class PlayerSystem : SystemSignalsOnly, ISignalOnPlayerAdded
{
    public void OnPlayerAdded(Frame frame, Player
